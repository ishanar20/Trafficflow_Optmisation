# Trafficflow_Optmisation
Overview
The Traffic Flow Optimization project aims to enhance the management and flow of traffic in urban areas by using algorithms and models for optimizing traffic signal timings and patterns. This project uses data analysis and machine learning to simulate and optimize traffic flows.

Features
Traffic Data Analysis: Analyzes traffic data to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
Optimization Algorithms: Implements algorithms to optimize traffic flow, such as adaptive traffic signal control systems.
Simulation: Simulates real-time traffic scenarios to test optimization methods.
Installation
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/ishanar20/Trafficflow_Optmisation.git
cd Trafficflow_Optmisation
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, list your dependencies manually, e.g., numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.

Usage
Running the Main Program
To run the main program, execute the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
python MainProgram.py
This will initiate the traffic flow optimization process.

Configuration
If needed, modify the configuration files or parameters within the program to match your local environment or specific needs (e.g., data files, traffic parameters).
